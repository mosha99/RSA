Warning: Due to the fact that all encryption processes are done in the front and in the browser, if you choose a large number, you have to wait for more time.
Suggested number of digits: 2 to 4

Then, if you are sure that the numbers are prime, just click the GENERATE WITHOUT VALIDATION option, and if you want to make sure that your numbers are prime, do the validation first.
Warning: This algorithm encounters numbers without prime numbers

### Second step: message encryption

Note 1: You can put both numbers and characters in the text of the message, but if you use characters, the system will break the message into character codes so that it can work with it.

Note 2: The fifth step is optional and if you do not enter it, the raw text will be displayed to you
